# Odoo Design Exercice 

Export is in dist file. Has to be launch with server.

### Improvements 
 1. First when I got the mockup, I noticed it's for the client Odoo so I would have changed some colos : blue by purple and dark blue/purple by some dark grey. 
For the layout : 
 2. The 2nd section, for the "Tools" undersction, I would have remove the picture. It's masking some information and we don't really know what is. I would have put only the button "Play video" on top right of the "Awesome projects" card. And if the video has to be play in the page, I would make it appear (with a fade) above the content. 
 3. For the "Easy to install" part, it looks like the Google Play store wasn't the official button. I would have take the official one, it's more familiar for the visitors. 
 4. And the end of the 2nd section, I would have attached the "Infinite solutions" section with reste of the page and put it on full-screen. Right now, it looks like a little bit lost in all the space around. I would have kept the dashed, like this, we can still understand that is connect to the all sections above. 
 5. For the Awards section, I centered all the cards. Maybe, I would have put its on 2 lines centered to give them more space. 
 6. Footer : I would have aligned the menu on the right to keep some balance.
